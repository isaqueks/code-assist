# AI Software Engineering Assistant

This project implements an AI-driven assistant designed to augment software engineering processes. It leverages the OpenAI GPT model to facilitate interactions, automate tasks, and provide support in various development operations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- **`src/entity`**: Contains the data entity definitions.
- **`src/handlers`**: Includes handlers for specific action functions.
- **`src/services`**: Responsible for interacting with external APIs like OpenAI GPT.
- **`src/utilities`**: Provides utility functions to handle file operations and similar tasks.

## Installation and Setup
